        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
            Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Theodore, and I am a recent college graduate who has started to hear more and more stories about how people are struggling to retire because they didn’t start saving early enough. This inspired me to create this platform to help others take control of their financial future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Did you know that according to a 2023 study by the Federal Reserve, nearly 25% of Americans have no retirement savings at all? Additionally, many people who do save often underestimate how much they will need to maintain their lifestyle in retirement. These statistics are alarming, and they highlight the importance of starting early and planning effectively.
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal with this website is to provide tools, resources, and information to make retirement planning easier and more accessible for everyone. Whether you're just starting your career or nearing retirement, I hope this platform can help you make informed decisions and achieve your goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I truly believe that everyone deserves a safe and happy retirement. By starting early and making smart financial choices, we can all work toward a future where financial stress is minimized, and we can enjoy the fruits of our labor. I wish you all the best on your journey, and I hope this website can be a helpful companion along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            Together, let’s build a world where everyone can retire safely and happily.
        </p>
